# Project Overview

I've been playing and experimenting with MS Hololens (the first one) back in 2018. This project was made as a proof-of-concept for augmenting scaled architectural models (physical).

The model is aligned at first by using image recognition, after which recognition can be turned off by clicking on the designated spot. Then the Hololens' internal SLAM tracking takes over.
It's fascinanting how stable their tracking is, however the model does drift a couple of centimeters when you walk to the opposite side (however, returns to it's proper position when you walk back). This app is made in Unity Engine and uses Vuforia for image recognition.

# Preview
notes: shown without the physical model, just the AR overlays; captured by Hololens - actual visuals are different (black=transparent, much better display resolution etc.)
